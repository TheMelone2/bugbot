# BugBot - AI - Powered Bug reporting for Discord
Have you ever had any issues while being on the platform Discord? You probably have encountered some platform bugs and wanted to report it but saw how of a pain it is to report it and wait months for it to be quitly (I can't spell ik) fixed. Now not anymore with BugBot it will make bug reporting way easier, more accessible and better. 

This comes from someone (me) who reports bugs for a living and participated in some special projects by Discord like the Bug Bounty Program, Playtesting  Discord Activities and writing bug reports. BugBot combines that real‑world experience with AI to make reporting bugs easier for everyone.

With a simple command like `/bugreport`, BugBot uses AI to turn your issue into a clear, structured report and redirects you to the official Discord bug site with everything pre‑filled. Bug reporting becomes faster, more accessible, and far more effective.

**| how will BugBot work: **

Step 1. User Command
`/bugreport When I join a voice channel, my microphone randomly disconnects after 2 minutes`

Step 2. AI Processing

BugBot takes the raw input and transforms it into a professional bug report.

It generates:

- Title: concise summary of the issue

- Description: detailed explanation rewritten in clear language

- Steps to Reproduce: automatically suggested from the user’s input (User Input required)

- Environment: system info (OS, app version, browser) User input required

Step 3 Auto‑Fill Integration

- BugBot packages this structured report into the fields required by Discord’s bug report site.

- It then provides the user with a direct link where everything is already filled in.

- The user only needs to review and click Submit, cutting the reporting process down to seconds.

Step 4 Confirmation in Discord 

BugBot sends a confirmation embed back in the server (or dm's the user directly), showing the polished report:

 `Bug report prepared!`
`Title: Microphone disconnects after 2 minutes in voice channels`
`Status: Ready to submit`

You might as yourself how does the AI work: 

**🤖 | How the AI Works**

- BugBot’s AI is trained on thousands of real bug reports (including anonymized examples from open bug trackers and community submissions).

ℹ️ **Do note**: The Data is from Public Bug Trackers, Public Community Feedback from the forums page, Synthetic Data (fake bug reports) and Community Contributions

- It learns the structure of high‑quality reports: concise titles, clear descriptions, reproducible steps, and environment details.

- When a user submits raw input, BugBot transforms it into a professional bug report format automatically.
